# Comparison: Old vs New Implementation

This section provides a detailed comparison between the old and new implementations of the network flow algorithms. We'll examine key aspects of both implementations to highlight improvements, trade-offs, and the reasoning behind the changes.

## Graph Representation

### Old Implementation
- Used `EdgeDB` for storing edges
- Separate `Adjacencies` structure for managing graph connectivity
- Lazy evaluation of adjacencies

### New Implementation
- Introduces `FlowGraph` structure
- Integrated storage of nodes, edges, trust limits, and balances
- Efficient caching mechanisms for edge information
- Direct support for dynamic graph updates

**Improvement**: The new `FlowGraph` provides a more cohesive and efficient representation of the network, improving both performance and ease of use.

## Algorithm Flexibility

### Old Implementation
- Single implementation of Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
- Fixed path search strategy

### New Implementation
- Modular design with `NetworkFlowAlgorithm` trait
- Support for multiple algorithms (Ford-Fulkerson, Capacity Scaling, Push-Relabel)
- Flexible path search strategies (BFS, Bidirectional BFS)

**Improvement**: The new implementation offers greater flexibility, allowing for easy addition of new algorithms and optimization for different network types.

## Performance Optimizations

### Old Implementation
- Basic Ford-Fulkerson implementation
- Potential inefficiencies with high-capacity edges

### New Implementation
- Introduces Capacity Scaling algorithm
- Optimized path search with scaling factor
- Improved caching strategies in `FlowGraph`

**Improvement**: The new implementation, especially with Capacity Scaling and Push-Relabel, offers better performance for networks with high-capacity edges and provides more consistent performance across different network types.

## Additional Features

### Old Implementation
- Basic flow computation and path finding

### New Implementation
- Introduces `FlowRecorder` for step-by-step analysis and visualization
- Better integration with external systems (e.g., visualization tools)
- More comprehensive error handling and logging

**Improvement**: The new implementation provides powerful tools for analysis, debugging, and visualization, enhancing both development and educational aspects of the project.

## Code Modularity and Maintainability

### Old Implementation
- Tightly coupled components
- Limited separation of concerns

### New Implementation
- Clear separation between graph structure, path search, and flow algorithms
- Use of traits for defining common interfaces
- More modular and extensible design

**Improvement**: The new implementation is more maintainable and extensible, allowing for easier updates and additions to the codebase.

## Memory Usage

### Old Implementation
- Potential memory inefficiencies with lazy adjacency evaluation

### New Implementation
- More efficient memory usage with integrated `FlowGraph` structure
- Potential for higher memory usage when using `FlowRecorder`

**Trade-off**: While general memory usage is improved, the additional features like `FlowRecorder` may increase memory requirements in some scenarios.

## Scalability

### Old Implementation
- May struggle with very large networks

### New Implementation
- Better equipped to handle large-scale networks
- Capacity Scaling and Push-Relabel algorithms improve performance on large, high-capacity networks

**Improvement**: The new implementation offers better scalability, particularly for large and complex network structures.

## Conclusion

The new implementation represents a significant advancement over the old one, offering improved flexibility, performance, and analytical capabilities. While it introduces some additional complexity, the benefits in terms of maintainability, extensibility, and scalability make it a more robust solution for a wide range of network flow problems.

The modular design of the new implementation also sets a strong foundation for future enhancements and optimizations, allowing the project to evolve and adapt to new requirements and network types more easily.
