# New Implementation

This section provides a detailed overview of the current implementation of our network flow algorithms. This new implementation addresses many of the limitations of the previous version and introduces new features for improved flexibility, performance, and scalability.

## Key Improvements

- More flexible graph representation allowing for easier adaptation to different network types
- Support for multiple path search strategies, enabling performance optimization for different network structures
- Implementation of the Capacity Scaling algorithm for improved performance on networks with high-capacity edges
- Addition of a Flow Recorder for better visualization and debugging of the flow computation process
- Improved modularity and separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and extensible

## Design Philosophy

The new implementation focuses on:

1. **Flexibility**: Easily adaptable to different types of network flow problems
2. **Performance**: Optimized for large-scale networks with various structural characteristics
3. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns between graph representation, path search, and flow algorithms
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new algorithms or modify existing ones without affecting other parts of the system

This new implementation provides a more robust and versatile solution for network flow problems, addressing the limitations of the previous version while introducing new capabilities for handling complex and large-scale networks.
