# Theoretical Background

This section provides an overview of the theoretical concepts underlying the network flow algorithms used in our project. Understanding these concepts is crucial for grasping the implementation details and design choices made in both the old and new versions of our system.

These theoretical foundations form the basis for the implementations discussed in later sections. Understanding these concepts will help in appreciating the design choices and optimizations made in both the old and new implementations of our network flow algorithms.
