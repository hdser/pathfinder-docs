# New Implementation: Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

The new implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm leverages the improved `FlowGraph` structure and the flexible path search strategies to provide a more efficient and adaptable solution for computing maximum flow in a network.

## Implementation Structure

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is implemented as a struct that implements the `NetworkFlowAlgorithm` trait:

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct FordFulkerson;

impl NetworkFlowAlgorithm for FordFulkerson {
    fn compute_flow(
        &self,
        graph: &FlowGraph,
        source: &Address,
        sink: &Address,
        requested_flow: U256,
        max_distance: Option<u64>,
        max_transfers: Option<u64>,
        path_search_algorithm: PathSearchAlgorithm,
        recorder: Option<&mut FlowRecorder>
    ) -> (U256, Vec<Edge>) {
        // Implementation...
    }
}
```

## Key Components

### 1. Flow Computation Loop

The main loop of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm:

```rust
loop {
    let (path_flow, path) = PathSearch::find_path(
        path_search_algorithm,
        &mut residual_graph,
        source,
        sink,
        target_flow - flow,
        max_distance,
        Some(U256::from(10000000000000000))
    );
    
    if path_flow == U256::default() || path.is_empty() {
        break;
    }

    flow += path_flow;
    Self::update_flow(&mut residual_graph, &path, path_flow, &mut flow_paths);

    // Recording step if a recorder is provided
    if let Some(ref mut recorder) = recorder {
        recorder.record_step(flow, path.clone(), path_flow, residual_graph.clone());
    }

    if flow >= target_flow {
        break;
    }
}
```

### 2. Flow Update

The `update_flow` method updates the residual graph and records the flow paths:

```rust
fn update_flow(graph: &mut FlowGraph, path: &[Address], path_flow: U256, flow_paths: &mut Vec<Edge>) {
    let mut actual_flow = path_flow;
    
    // Determine the actual flow possible
    for window in path.windows(2) {
        let from = window[0];
        let to = window[1];
        let token = graph.get_edge_token(&from, &to).expect("Edge not found");
        let available_capacity = graph.get_edge_capacity(&from, &to, &token);
        actual_flow = min(actual_flow, available_capacity);
    }
    
    // Update the graph with the actual flow
    for window in path.windows(2) {
        let from = window[0];
        let to = window[1];
        let token = graph.get_edge_token(&from, &to).expect("Edge not found");
        
        graph.update_edge_capacity(&from, &to, &token, actual_flow);
        
        flow_paths.push(Edge {
            from,
            to,
            token,
            capacity: actual_flow,
        });

        // Mark both nodes as dirty
        graph.invalidate_cache(&from);
        graph.invalidate_cache(&to);
    }
}
```

## Key Features

1. **Flexible Path Search**: The algorithm can use different path search strategies (BFS, Bidirectional BFS) based on the `path_search_algorithm` parameter.

2. **Flow Recording**: Optional integration with a `FlowRecorder` for visualizing and analyzing the flow computation process.

3. **Efficient Graph Updates**: Utilizes the `FlowGraph` structure's methods for efficient updates of edge capacities and node caches.

4. **Termination Conditions**: Implements multiple termination conditions (no more augmenting paths, reached requested flow, etc.) for efficiency.

5. **Maximum Flow Estimation**: Uses the graph's `estimate_max_flow` method to set a realistic target flow.

## Improvements Over the Old Implementation

1. **Modularity**: Clear separation between the flow algorithm, graph structure, and path search strategy.

2. **Flexibility**: Easy to switch between different path search algorithms without changing the core Ford-Fulkerson implementation.

3. **Efficiency**: Utilizes the improved caching and update mechanisms of the new `FlowGraph` structure.

4. **Visualization**: Integration with `FlowRecorder` allows for better debugging and analysis of the flow computation process.

5. **Scalability**: Better handling of large graphs through more efficient data structures and algorithms.

## Considerations

1. **Performance Tuning**: The choice of path search algorithm and parameters like `max_distance` can significantly impact performance and should be tuned based on the network characteristics.

2. **Memory Usage**: While more efficient than the old implementation, processing very large graphs may still require significant memory.

3. **Flow Recording Overhead**: When using a `FlowRecorder`, there may be additional computational and memory overhead, especially for large graphs or high iteration counts.

## Conclusion

The new Ford-Fulkerson implementation provides a more flexible, efficient, and scalable solution for computing maximum flow in complex networks. By leveraging the improved `FlowGraph` structure and modular path search strategies, it addresses many of the limitations of the old implementation while introducing new capabilities for handling large-scale networks and providing insights into the flow computation process.

This implementation sets a solid foundation for further enhancements and optimizations, such as the Capacity Scaling algorithm, which we'll explore in the next section.
