# New Implementation: Capacity Scaling Algorithm

The Capacity Scaling algorithm is an enhanced version of the Ford-Fulkerson method that aims to improve performance, especially for networks with high-capacity edges. This implementation builds upon the flexible structure established for the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, integrating seamlessly with the `FlowGraph` and path search strategies.

## Implementation Structure

Like the Ford-Fulkerson implementation, the Capacity Scaling algorithm is implemented as a struct that implements the `NetworkFlowAlgorithm` trait:

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct CapacityScaling;

impl NetworkFlowAlgorithm for CapacityScaling {
    fn compute_flow(
        &self,
        graph: &FlowGraph,
        source: &Address,
        sink: &Address,
        requested_flow: U256,
        max_distance: Option<u64>,
        max_transfers: Option<u64>,
        path_search_algorithm: PathSearchAlgorithm,
        recorder: Option<&mut FlowRecorder>
    ) -> (U256, Vec<Edge>) {
        // Implementation...
    }
}
```

## Key Components

### 1. Scaling Factor Initialization

The algorithm starts by determining the initial scaling factor:

```rust
let max_capacity = residual_graph.get_max_capacity();
let mut scale = U256::from(1);
while scale * U256::from(2) <= max_capacity {
    scale = scale * U256::from(2);
}
```

### 2. Main Loop

The main loop of the Capacity Scaling algorithm:

```rust
while scale > U256::from(0) {
    let mut tries = 0;
    loop {
        let (path_flow, path) = PathSearch::find_path(
            path_search_algorithm,
            &mut residual_graph,
            source,
            sink,
            requested_flow - flow,
            max_distance,
            Some(std::cmp::max(scale, min_flow_increase))
        );
        
        if path_flow == U256::default() || path_flow < min_flow_increase || tries >= max_tries_per_scale {
            break;
        }

        flow += path_flow;
        Self::update_flow(&mut residual_graph, &path, path_flow, &mut flow_paths);

        if let Some(ref mut recorder) = recorder {
            recorder.record_step(flow, path.clone(), path_flow, residual_graph.clone());
        }

        if flow >= requested_flow {
            return (flow, flow_paths);
        }

        tries += 1;
    }
    scale = scale / U256::from(2);
}
```

### 3. Path Search with Scaling

The path search is modified to consider only edges with capacity greater than or equal to the current scale:

```rust
Some(std::cmp::max(scale, min_flow_increase))
```

This parameter is passed to the path search algorithm to filter out low-capacity edges.

## Key Features

1. **Adaptive Scaling**: The algorithm adapts the scale factor based on the network's maximum capacity, allowing it to work efficiently on networks with varying capacity ranges.

2. **Minimum Flow Increase**: A minimum flow increase threshold (`min_flow_increase`) ensures that the algorithm doesn't spend too much time on insignificant flow improvements.

3. **Maximum Tries per Scale**: Limits the number of attempts at each scale to prevent excessive iterations on difficult-to-improve flows.

4. **Integration with Path Search Strategies**: Like the Ford-Fulkerson implementation, it can use different path search algorithms based on the `path_search_algorithm` parameter.

5. **Flow Recording**: Optional integration with a `FlowRecorder` for visualization and analysis.

## Advantages Over Basic Ford-Fulkerson

1. **Improved Performance on High-Capacity Networks**: By focusing on high-capacity paths first, the algorithm can find a good approximation of the maximum flow more quickly.

2. **Fewer Augmenting Paths**: The scaling approach typically results in fewer, but more significant, flow augmentations compared to the basic Ford-Fulkerson method.

3. **Better Worst-Case Time Complexity**: While the basic Ford-Fulkerson can have poor performance on certain graph structures, Capacity Scaling provides a more consistent performance across different network types.

4. **Adaptability**: The algorithm adapts its behavior based on the network's capacity distribution, making it effective across a wide range of network types.

## Considerations

1. **Memory Usage**: Similar to the Ford-Fulkerson implementation, processing very large graphs may require significant memory.

2. **Parameter Tuning**: The performance of the algorithm can be sensitive to parameters like `min_flow_increase` and `max_tries_per_scale`. These may need tuning based on the specific characteristics of the network.

3. **Complexity**: The implementation is more complex than the basic Ford-Fulkerson, which may make it slightly harder to understand and maintain.

## Conclusion

The Capacity Scaling implementation provides a powerful enhancement to the basic Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, offering improved performance and adaptability for a wide range of network types. By leveraging the flexible `FlowGraph` structure and modular path search strategies, it maintains the advantages of the new implementation architecture while introducing specialized optimizations for high-capacity networks.

This implementation represents a significant step forward in the project's ability to handle large-scale, complex network flow problems efficiently. Its integration with the existing components demonstrates the flexibility and extensibility of the new implementation's design.
